# Passenger Counter - My first Java Script practice

## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Very simple counting application to practice Java Script. Inspired by Scrimba / Per Borgen

The user can define the number to be saved by pressing the Increment button to reach the desired amount, and by pressing the Save button, the number is saved and can be reviewed later. In this case, the number represents how many people board the train at the station.
